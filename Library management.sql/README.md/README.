# Library Management System

## Project Description
This project is a MySQL-based database management system for a library. It manages books, authors, categories, members, and loans, with proper relationships and constraints. The system supports:
- Tracking books and their availability
- Managing library members
- Recording book loans and returns
- Maintaining relationships (1-M, M-M) between entities

## How to Run/Setup
1. Install MySQL and MySQL Workbench (or another MySQL client).
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
3. Import the `library_management.sql` file:
   - Go to `File > Open SQL Script` and select `library_management.sql`.
   - Execute the script to create the database and tables.
4. Verify the database structure and sample data using `SELECT` queries.
